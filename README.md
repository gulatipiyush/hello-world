| **Part 2 — Hackathon: Parallel Breakout Roundtable Sessions**                                                                                     | **110 mins** |
| Groups of attendees are invited to collaboratively develop research designs. The discussion at each roundtable is semi-structured, centred around the research “seeds” introduced in the plenary and attendees’ research expertise and interests. Scholars at different stages of their careers and from different disciplinary and demographic backgrounds will benefit from this format, since they will have the opportunity to interact in the more intimate and friendly environment of a roundtable. All tables will be provided with a structured template to aid the idea development process and facilitators will annotate the key ideas discussed in each table to facilitate further discussion and research collaborations. 
Includes one break (10 mins). | |
